# fishbook
An app for logging and searching fishing data.  Using Meteor framework.

To run, type meteor into a Terminal or Command Prompt and it'll show the URL of the page to navigate to.

This is very early days.  See Issues.

The code was vaguely adapted from this tutorial example https://github.com/davidturnbull/leaderboard-v3.
